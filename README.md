# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Gleb Shalimov. Currently I work mainly with Dart and Flutter for application development and JavaScript for website development. In my free time I create my own small projects and get into Generative Art. I like to create clean, user-friendly and accessible user interfaces for both users and developers.

### Side projects:

- [Gen Art Backgrounds Flutter package](https://pub.dev/packages/gen_art_bg)
- [Raycast extensions](https://www.raycast.com/khlebobul)
- [Wave Logo Generator](https://wave-logo.vercel.app/)

You can learn more about me by visiting my personal [website](https://khlebobul.github.io).
