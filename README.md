# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Gleb Shalimov. Currently I work mainly with Dart and Flutter for application development and JavaScript for website development. In my free time I create my own small projects and get into Generative Art. I like to create clean, user-friendly and accessible user interfaces for both users and developers.

### Side projects:
